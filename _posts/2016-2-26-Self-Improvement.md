excerpt: My favourite language, my studying goals and how I got into competitive programming
---




### Programming
I feel that it's time I levelled up. All these years I tried different languages but couldn't settle on one. I just learned enough of a language to complete whatever project I had at hand. But I always favoured one:   

**Javascript**  

And now I've decided to focus (almost exclusively) on that. I've always thought of javascript as simplified java. Turns out it's not that simple though...Yes, it's very simple to manipulate a few dom elements with javascript, but it's exactly that simple syntax that can cause all sorts of problems if  you're not careful enough.  

My goals are to learn:  

* How to write unit tests (I had a first try editing a test for [greek-in-tech](https://github.com/tsevdos/greek-in-tech))
* Javascript in depth (especially objects and modules)
* One or two popular javascript frameworks

And that's just the beginning. 

### Competitive Programming
I started studying algorithms again. I let my knowledge of algorithms slip after finishing university. When working on projects I was mainly focused on getting the job done, because that was the only thing that mattered to a fresh graduate. That meant using libraries instead of trying to make everything myself and copying code snippets from stack overflow and various other places.  

Reading from books was a bit boring. [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/) makes things more interesting by providing examples and solutions to common coding problems. But I had to find something more exciting to keep me interested long run. Fortunately, I (re)discovered competitive programming after reading a [blog post](http://railswalker.com/extra-resources-for-free-code-camp/) by freeCodeCamper Xristos Kokkolios. He gathered some great resources for the rest of us freeCodeCampers that I'll be checking out one by one. (I've already read most of [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), a book that explains javascript concepts not in dry technical language but well articulated narration.)   

I tried both [codefights](https://codefights.com), a platform better suited for competing(my favourite so far) and [codewars](http://www.codewars.com/), which is better suited for learning. When you're coding against the clock (or another player) even the easiest problems become challenging, and the difficult ones can leave you completely dumbfounded. 

[Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) is another competitive coding platform that supports many more languages than the previous two (I even saw LOLCODE supported in an excercise!) and has problems split in domains.  

 Try them out and find your favourite!
