## FreeCodeCamp
Here is a report of the FreeCodeCamp projects I've completed so far. I've set aside time in my schedule to work on zipline projects for two days a week so I'm making steady progress.  I've completed five frontend projects for freeCodeCamp, and I have another five to go before claiming my front-end certificate. 

*  [Portfolio](http://codepen.io/faysvas/pen/BjVdvN) page - I fulfilled all the user stories but I'm not that satisfied with the design. I want to add a parallax effect on top like the example project.
* [Random Quote Machine](http://codepen.io/faysvas/pen/obJGMp). - I used [Materialize.css](http://materializecss.com/) for the first time. At first glance it looks prettier and easier to use than bootstrap. It offers more styling choices out of the box and it's style generally looks like the style I tried to achieve with bootstrap.
* [Javascript Calculator](http://codepen.io/faysvas/pen/QyRoyB) - A tricky project. There were so many cases and it was easy for bugs to creep in. But that's ok because  the friendly people over at [Athens Free Code Camp](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.athens.greece) with their bug tracking skills came to the rescue. You can post a project and have feedback within a day(or even a few minutes sometimes!). I've learned tons of stuff just by reviewing their projects (And having them review mine).
* [Wikipedia Viewer](http://codepen.io/faysvas/pen/wGvybB) - I made it a bit hastily, I have to imrpove the design. The wikipedia API is a bit of a pain to work with, but everything turned out fine. 
* [Local Weather](http://codepen.io/faysvas/pen/VeJeYy) - I didn't have much inspiration so I went with a monochrome flat design for this one. 
##GFOSS Articles
I'm also a regular (greek) article writer for GFOSS now. I've commited to writing an article every 15 days. Here are the two articles I've written: 

* [FreeCodeCamp Article](https://edu.ellak.gr/2016/02/04/dorean-mathimata-programmatismou-apo-to-freecodecamp/) 
* [Alternative Block Chains: Ethereum](https://opensource.ellak.gr/2016/02/23/alternative-block-chains-ethereum/) 
##Angular 
I started studying Angular at last and it turned out to be a very rewarding experience. I was afraid that learning a framework would be a complicated and unnecessary ordeal but the [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) home site has a great and easy to follow tutorial.   Only learning the absolute basics I managed to make [EspaKad](http://faysvas.github.io/espakad/), a simple database filtering app in two days. I had to make a working version in such a hurry so there's still lot's of room for improvement.  You  can check out the [github repository](https://github.com/faysvas/espakad). I would appreciate any kind of contribution!
