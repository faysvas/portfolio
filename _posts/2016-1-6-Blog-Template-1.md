A few months ago (*I just checked my e-mails and it's been a whole year!*) a friend asked me to design a **template** for her blog [Παιδαγωγάκι](http://paidagogaki.blogspot.gr/) on blogger. We got together, discussed a basic layout, took some notes and lost them. I vaguely remember that she wanted a two column layout with a  "school/kindergarten" theme so until I find those notes I'll start with that.(I should convince her to make github issues).

So, first step, I make the good old github repo. Github suggests "curly-goggles" so I'll stick with that. 


Usually whenever I had to make a template for [blogger](https://www.blogger.com/)  (or any other CMS), I'd find a free template I liked and modified it to fit my site. But unless you need only a few minor changes, trying to figure out the template and where you need to make changes soon becomes very tedious. So I'll try to find the absolute most basic blogger template and try to apply the tricks I've learned from reading [css weekly](http://css-weekly.com/) every week. 


I thought I was above making a Google Analytics web tracking code for this blog but I'm not. And while I'm at it, I might as well make one for [BioTaxonomy](http://ellak-monades-aristeias.github.io/BioTaxonomy/) too. The project demo has been up since September but I have no idea if people have been visiting it (BioTaxonomy is soon getting a remake, it's grand journey also going to be documented in this blog).
