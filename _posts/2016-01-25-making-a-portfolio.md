title: "Where is my portfolio?"
---


For the past few months I've been wanting to expand my portfolio but I just couldn't think of any projects I'd like to make. The seminars and code schools offered by various greek universities participating in the [FOSS Centers of Excellence](https://ma.ellak.gr/) program, have helped me a lot with that. I made some minor contributions to existing open source software([edx](https://www.edx.org/), [stork](https://www.eid-stork.eu/))during some team projects and made some projects of my own ([TinyCollab](https://github.com/faysvas/TinyCollab) and right after that a [java project](https://github.com/faysvas/Ekdhlwseis) (*after coding TinyCollab day and night for five days, I can't say I was completely...focused when coding this one.* )).

I was also surprised pleasantly when my pitch towards a learning application for browsing animals and plants according to their taxonomy, ([BioTaxonomy](https://github.com/ellak-monades-aristeias/BioTaxonomy) - *my proudest achievement so far!*) was accepted and funded by the Greek Free/Open Source Software Society ([GFOSS](https://eellak.ellak.gr)). Creating BioTaxonomy was an amazing experience. It was the first time that I designed something that was truly my own, with requirements set by me instead of a client or employer. Looking back, I made a lot of design and development mistakes (*that I'm hoping to fix with BioTaxonomy 2.0*), but I managed to finish it in time. It was the first time I used Bootstrap and jQuery extensively for a project so it was mostly a learning process. 

Lately many sites have been offering premium courses that help you complete portfolio-worthy projects.   

- [Coursera](www.coursera.org)'s Specializations
- [Udacity's](www.udacity.com) Nanodegrees (_that even guarantee getting you a job!_)
- [Codecademy](www.codecademy.com)'s Pro Paths
- [Trydesignlab](www.trydesignlab.com)'s Design and UX Courses

They all look very promising(and I'll probably try one of them at some point). But a few days ago I was so excited to discover freeCodeCamp, an open source community with a free programming course. It includes basic exercises in html, css and javascript, and even more advanced algorithm exercises(*those really challenged me and I have to admit that I directly copied some answers so I could study them...*) that includes some basic web projects you can then show off on CodePen or github. I'm working on the first Front End project right now, a personal portfolio web page.
